              <h2>My Plan</h2>
              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <p>
                For a while, I have seen tech YouTubers talking about having
                homelabs, which is just running servers at home and it gave me
                an idea to have my own one as well.
              </p>
              <h3>What is the plan?</h3>
              <p>
                Basically, I will be putting things that require a lot of
                computer resources inside a virtual machine in a server. Then on
                a low-powered device, I could easily remote into it. The server
                will also host other services as well such as a media server,
                storing photos, and other things.
              </p>
              <h3>Why should you do it?</h3>
              <h4>Independence</h4>
              <p>
                These days, <em>way</em> more people rely on big tech to manage
                their lifes, and I wanted to move away from that idea. So around
                2018/19, I decided to slowly move away from it, starting with
                emails.
              </p>
              <h4>Minimal Computer Setup</h4>
              <p>
                So, you won't really need a massive tower on your desk for doing
                intensive tasks, for example, I could bring a low-powered device
                and just plug a single cable that powers my entire setup
                <i>(connects to keyboard, mouse, monitor, and ports)</i>. After
                that, I could remote into the virtual machine and do high
                intensive stuff on it like gaming or video editing.
